1. Grant of Use

Subject to the terms of this License and payment of the applicable fees,
the Authors grant the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
perpetual license to install and use the Software for one (1) production
purpose.

A production purpose means the operation of the Software for a single
customer or a single production environment.
- Each additional customer, project, or production environment requires
  the purchase of an additional license.
- Use of the Software for development, testing, or evaluation that does
  not generate revenue is permitted without additional licenses, provided
  that the Software is not distributed or made available to third parties.

2. Distribution and Resale

The Licensee may not publish, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, sell,
or otherwise provide the Software (in original or modified form) to any
third party, except under a separate written agreement with the Authors.

Developing Odoo modules that depend on the Software as a library
(e.g. importing or extending it) is permitted, provided that no source
code of the Software itself is copied. Such modules may be distributed
under any license that is compatible with this License (including LGPL,
MIT, or proprietary licenses similar to this one).

3. SaaS and Multi-Tenant Use

Operating the Software as part of a hosted service or SaaS offering that
serves multiple third-party customers is considered a form of
distribution. This is not permitted under this License.
To use the Software in a SaaS context, or to make it available to
multiple third-party customers, the Licensee must obtain a separate
commercial agreement with the Authors.

4. Modifications

The Licensee may modify the Software for its licensed purpose. Modified
versions are subject to the same restrictions as the original Software
