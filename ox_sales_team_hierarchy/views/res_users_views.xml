        Note: The Team Leader group appears in the native groups list as "User: Team Leader Access"
        Users can check/uncheck it directly there, following Odoo's native pattern.
        No separate boolean field is needed - this matches how "User: All Documents" and 
        "User: Own Documents Only" work in Odoo.
