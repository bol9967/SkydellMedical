    <!-- 
        Record rules for team leader access are implemented via Python code
        by overriding the _search method in each model (sale.order, crm.lead, etc.)
        This aligns with Odoo 18's native pattern of extending search behavior.
        
        The _search override extends the standard search to include team member records
        for users who are team leaders, allowing them to see their team members' records.
        
        No XML record rules are needed here since we can't use computed fields in
        record rule domains during XML parsing. The Python-based approach is more
        flexible and aligns with Odoo 18's architecture.
